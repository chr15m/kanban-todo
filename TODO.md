# Main project

## TODO

- [ ] Can we make the columns vertically fill the available space?
- [ ] Minimize the number of times the user is asked for access. If possible ask for all the access required at one time.
- [ ] Ability to rename columns.

## In progress


## Done

- [x] Plus button in the columns to add a new item, with text input.
- [x] Ability to create columns.
- [x] Moving cards around janks the file.
- [x] When dragging between columns we should show the insertion point and insert the card at that point.
- [x] Dropdown for setting the card as checked/unchecked.
- [x] Make it look more the makesprite/concrete.css theme.
- [x] When moving between columns don't insert an extra newline before, unless moving to an empty column.
- [x] Give each column a max width of 450px and have them stretch to fill the area up to that.
- [x] Don't put carriage returns between individual TODO list items. As far as possible try to preserve original formatting, just moving individual lines around without disturbing other lines.
- [x] Ability to create a project on the projects select page, including if TODO.md is empty.
