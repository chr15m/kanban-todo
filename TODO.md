# Main project

## TODO

- [ ] Don't put carriage returns between individual TODO list items. As far as possible try to preserve original formatting, just moving individual lines around without disturbing other lines.

- [ ] Ability to create a project on the projects select page, including if TODO.md is empty.

- [ ] Ability to create, move, remove columns.

- [ ] Plus button in the columns to add a new item, with text input.

- [ ] Make it look more the makesprite/concrete.css theme.

- [ ] Minimize the number of times the user is asked for access. If possible ask for all the access required at one time.

- [x] Give each column a max width of 450px and have them stretch to fill the area up to that.
